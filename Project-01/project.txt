Great approach! Here’s your **step-by-step roadmap** to building the **CLI-based Student Management System** 🚀  

---

### **Step 1: Plan the Features**  
Your CLI should allow users to:  
✅ **Add students** (Name, Roll Number, Marks)  
✅ **View all students**  
✅ **Search for a student by Roll Number**  
✅ **Delete a student**  
✅ **Exit the program**  

---

### **Step 2: Structure the Project**  
Break it down into logical parts:  
1️⃣ **Main Program (CLI Loop)** – This will continuously prompt users for input.  
2️⃣ **Functions** for each feature (e.g., `add_student()`, `view_students()`).  
3️⃣ **Data Storage** – Use a file (`students.txt` or JSON) to store student records.  
4️⃣ **Custom Exceptions** for handling invalid inputs.  
5️⃣ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** for a well-structured approach.  

---

### **Step 3: Implement Basic CLI Loop**  
- Use an infinite loop (`while True`) to keep the program running.  
- Display a **menu** with options (1. Add Student, 2. View, etc.).  
- Use `input()` to take user choices and call respective functions.  
- Provide an **exit option** (`break` the loop).  

---

### **Step 4: Implement Core Functionalities**  
1️⃣ **Add Student**  
   - Take user input (Name, Roll No, Marks).  
   - Store it in a file (`students.txt` or `students.json`).  

2️⃣ **View Students**  
   - Read the file and display all students.  

3️⃣ **Search Student**  
   - Ask for Roll Number and find in the file.  

4️⃣ **Delete Student**  
   - Remove a student's data by Roll Number and update the file.  

5️⃣ **Handle Edge Cases**  
   - What if the file is empty?  
   - What if the Roll Number doesn’t exist?  
   - What if the user enters invalid input?  

---

### **Step 5: Add Exception Handling & Validation**  
- Use **try-except** to catch input errors.  
- Implement a **custom exception** like `StudentNotFoundError`.  

---

### **Step 6: Test Your CLI Tool**  
- Test with different inputs.  
- Try edge cases (searching for a non-existing student, deleting from an empty file).  
- Handle unexpected inputs (e.g., entering text instead of a number).  

---

### **Final Step: Improve & Optimize**  
🔹 **Add Data Persistence** – Store students in JSON instead of text for better structure.  
🔹 **Make the CLI User-Friendly** – Use formatting (`print(f"{name: <10} {roll: <5} {marks: <5}")`).  
🔹 **Expand Features** – Add grade calculation, sorting, or updating student records.
